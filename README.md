# Pewdictus Web API
A collection of scripts and tools used for logging into vindictus private servers...

## NMServer
This was originally created by [Ulkyome](https://github.com/ulkyome/NMServer). I've updated nmserver to work with my custom PHP api for anyone who wants to add some kind of web management to their vindictus private server.

The server can be started without the startup parameters.
Then the -perver option will be true
you can set the startup parameters separately for example, you can set the -server=http://yourserver and -pserver=false parameters in the boxes to get post requests to your web server 
post name userID and password
